                Once Opon A time, There was a Man called "Richald" <br>
                This Man, in the world they called him "CaveMan", because he was saving people from rocks and caves <br>
                One day, Richald's wife, "Luna", Said to him, "Let's talk," and Richald said "Ok", She said "I saw in the news about a rockfall about to happen in the mountains of Rockald"  <br>
                Richald, ran to his suit to save the people there <br>   
            </p>

            <p>
                He started his journey to the mountains of Rockald, <br>
                But, so many things came on him in his road, but started with peace, <br>
                Someone called "Rafald" saw Richald, and cried saying "Help me Richald!" <br>
                Richald, with his kindness, came to him, and said to him "What do you need" <br>
                Rafald said while he is crying "My wife entered in prison, with no reason!" <br>
                Richald said "Did she do anything before she entered?" <br>
                Rafald said while he is crying "No, She was in our house playing a game called pocket with me and her chlidren Waa Waa Waa" <br>
                Richald said "Ok, Give me some time to think, also, What is your name?" <br>
                Rafald said "My name is Rafald and My wife's photo is here and her name is" <br>
                Richald stopped him and said "Ok Rafald, but sorry, I have to.............. Ah, to go, Sorry, So Sorry" <br>
                Rafald said "It is ok, but don't forget me!" <br>
                Richald said "Ok, bye" <br>
                Rafald said "Bye, Waa Waa Waa" <br>
                Richald went to continue but placed in his To-Do list: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li class="tasks">
                        Go to the mountains of Rockald
                    </li>
                    <li class="tasks">
                        Check Rafald's wife
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Richald kept on moving and moving until he found Rafald's wife in the street <br>
                Richald said to himself "Rafald was lying on me, let me ask her what did happen." <br>
                Richald came to her and said "Hi, you are Rafald's wife, right." <br>
                She said "Yes" <br>
                Richald said "Ok, now, here is a record for a conversation between me and your husband." <br>
                She said "Weird, Why did he say this!? I am not in prison!? A Bad, And the worse man in the world!" <br>
                Richald said "Ok, stop hypering and clam down please" <br>
                She said "Ok, I will clam down" <br>
                Richald said "All right, I am so sorry on disturbing you, I just needed to know if you are ok" <br>
                She said "It is all right, bye, I need to continue my work" <br>
                Richald said "It is ok, you can continue, bye" <br>
                She said "Bye"  <br>
                Richald went to continue but updated his To-Do list:
                <ol>
                    <li class="tasks">
                        Go to the mountains of Rockald
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Richald continued until he reached and found the rock about to fall, he ran to catch the rock before it hits anyone, It turns out a fake rock, not a fake one, but Rafald was about to make it fall <br>
                Richald said "Rafald!?" <br>
                Rafald ran and kept the rock to fall on Richald <br>
                But Richald broke it 100 pieces that are too small that a child can catch them! <br>
                When Richald was coming back, He saw someone killed! <br>
                He quickly ran to save him and take him to the hospital, but saw so many blood coming out of his body! <br>
                Richald didn't know what to do, so he just went to the hospital to save him. <br>
                The doctor said "he died, and you must pay $100 or otherwise, you will enter prison" <br>
                Richald payed and went back to his house, but, he got lost! <br>
            </p>
